<p>Hoizer - Eat Your Young

Eat your young is a song in the sixth extended play by the Irish maestro Hoizer alongside the two other tracks, All Things End, and Through Me (The Flood). The song protests against the power imbalance between the people and the governors of decision for an empire or capitalist state, generally addressing that of is east, west and within Europe in the northern hemisphere through using the grotesque metaphor, eat your young. Eat your young's sentiment is one of the rudimentary historical political arts published by Hoizer, announcing anti-capitalist protest for which he gives the view that if the punishment for something is a fine, it's a law for the poor. “Eat your young '' references the past that we are changing and the future that we are leaving, under the operation of capitalist foundational societies that condemn those of the unifluential to the govern of conscriptions for the meaningless stark foot tread warfares.

“I'm starving, darling let me put my lips to something let me wrap my teeth around the world start carving, darling.” Here Hozier applies an incorporation of a metaphor to exemplify the narrator's envy for those who have reached industrial domination under the capital and ever expanding constant of hunger for capital sought profit. The lyrics additionally proclaim the will of those with upheld success in capitalist ideology to change and the state's self induced impatience to conquer and stagnate regional flow of power. In capitalist societies those of success seek to uphold it and exert it in the form of influence, and those without it seek it like rabid dogs over scraps.The merchants who uphold success maintain a sphere of influence claiming the works of those who labour, repairing, gathering, supplying, cooking.“ I wanna smell the dinner cooking, I wanna feel the edges start to burn.” The subsequent presence of Hoizers use of colloquial language stones us with the prospect that the proletariat, working class individuals, who are only useful to the extent of being productional assets for the merchants, or the owners. Those in retail under capitalist societies watch and profit off the labour induced by the practical enterprise of the proletariat, they lay back and “smell the dinner cooking” and “feel the edges start to burn.''

“Honey, I wanna race you to the table if you hesitate, the getting is gone”
In this verse Hozier exhibits conditional clauses and verbalises a metaphor. The lyrics reference the impetuosity to avarice that a system built upon the structural basis of capitalism entails. It prompts the aspect of accumulation and exploitation for the path to self gain, to trap yourself till dissolution in the casino of wonders whilst the doors remain ajar. “Pull up the ladder when the flood comes, throw enough rope until the legs have swung.”
Hozier wittily uses the ladder as symbolism for purgation of the ruling class, bribed testimonies, pardons, subsidies, and prompted parole. They use the ladder to cut ties with the flood that they induced, succour their affluence by cutting the path behind them, using their predisposition to maintain their influence of the present. Capitalist society throws you only enough rope to hang yourself with. The bourgeois, class of owning, wrench the ladder and throw ropes weighted with nooses, to maintain rule of the hierarchy. The prospect that the proletariat have potential is disillusion, “It would be quicker and easier to eat your young.”“Seven new ways that you can eat your young” is a hyperbole buzzfeed title that shows ignorance in terms of time in relation to effect of an ideology like capitalism prompts.

“Come and get some, Skinning the children for a war drum Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns” In this verse Hozies evokes imagery for “Skinning the children” to implore the immorality of upper strata capitalist society. In ‘Punishing Saddam’ on May 12th 1996 Madeleine Albright averred "We think the price of half a million children is worth it." Reflecting on the USA’s middle eastern hauled oil that left them as the main supplier, through procurator fought wars and decades of occupation. They destroy and change as a calling for war and conflict as a war drum is an accompaniment instrument used to heed the march or the fight. “It's quicker and easier to eat your young” is the singularity of absurdness and main macabre of the lyrics. The ruling class will clothe with refined attires, adorn their homes with lavish amenities and dine under the roofs built off the motives of  blood money and extort benefits. We display societal conform for those who fail, hence oppress to succeed, we advocate brutal exploitations in the name of money, thus the bourgeois cumulate justification under profit rationale. The fraction of the extort benefits relinquished to feed the lineages portionally would have spared the lives of many if they ate their young in place.

“Honey, I'm making sure the table's made we can celebrate the good that we've done, I won't lie, if there's something still to take, There is ground to break, whatever's still to come”
Hozier uses an Allegory here as exemplification for the summing of infectiousness of capitalist ideals that are fed into the moist throats of developing countries. The capital compels the subjugation of a reflective mode of industry onto external civil bodies of liberty. They inaugurate capitalist ideology onto imperial nations, they hold iron caestus of influence and exploitation over modern colonies, after colour revolutions, coups and assassinations, as long as capitalist society withholds uptake of idiosyncratic pursuit of profit regulated welfares of general consensus for societies will remain moribund whilst oppression will course vigorous. “It's quicker and easier to eat your young.””Get some” Hozier blends repetition of “Get some” to display a powerful recurring motif  to call for action, for protest.

Hozier's song Eat Your Young is a rudimentary historical political art. He exhibits the prospects of 20th century United States of America and how the predominantly capitalist society bathed in the fruits of outsourced labour and reigned a tight grip on neo-colonies. Hozier uses his lyrics to evoke the reader to question modern and historical politics, how the inauguration of capitalist ideology onto imperial nations reaps the fields and leaves the lay of the land barren. He tries to pull the listener from the flock and lays out symphony like map, showing us how capitalism trails hereditary extort benefits to be shared with lineages. The governing class succouring their affluence by cutting the path they took and throwing society only enough rope to hang themselves with. Capitalism ensures societal conform for those who fail, hence oppress to succeed, it advocates brutal exploitations in the name of money. “The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don’t do anything about it.” – Albert Einstein
